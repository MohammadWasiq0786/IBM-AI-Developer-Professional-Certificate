#### Common Software Engineering Processes

1. **Requirements gathering**
* The software requirements specification (SRS) encompasses the process of collecting and documenting the set of requirements that the software needs to adhere to.
â€¢ It may include a set of use  cases that describe the business needs and user flows that the software must implement.

2. **Design**
*  Transforming requirements into code
* Breaking down requirements into sets of related components
* Communicating business rules and application logic

3. **Coding for quality**
Quality code must fulfill the intended requirements of the software without defects
* Clean and consistent
* Easy to read and maintain
* Well documented
* Efficient

Coding for quality entails following a set of coding practices during development
* Following coding standards
* Using linters to detect errors
* Commenting in the code itself to make it easy to understand and modify.

4. **Testing**
The process of verifying that the software matches established requirements and is free of bugs
* Identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements
* Ensures reliability, security, performance, and efficiency
* Software testing can often be automated or done manually
* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* System testing
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) or Beta testing

### Software Development Methodology

***Software Development Methodology***: A process is needed to clarity communication and facilitate information sharing among team members.

**Common Software Development Methodology**
1. **Waterfall**
2. **V-Shape Model** 
3. **Agile**

### 1. **Waterfall**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Plan] --> B[Design]
    B --> C[Develop]
    C --> D[Test]
    D --> E[Deploy]
    E --> F[Maintain]
```

| **Pros** |  **Cons** |
| -------- | --------- |
| Team members understand their responsibilities due to discrete, well-defined stages. | Lacks flexibility|
| Easier to estimate budget and allocate resources. | Change is hard to accommodate. |

### 2. **V-Shape Model** 

![v-shape](v-shape.png)

| **Pros** |  **Cons** |
| -------- | --------- |
| Easy to use | Redge |
| Test plans designed upfront saves development and testing time. | Does not accommodate changing requirements |

### 3. **Agile**

![agile](agile.png)

| **Pros** |  **Cons** |
| -------- | --------- |
| Changing requirements handled easily. | Budgeting and resource allocation is challenging. |
| Feedback incorporated regularly | Project scope not clearly defined. |

#### Sequential VS Iterative

* **`Sequential` : Waterfall and V-Shaped Model**
* **`Iterative`: Agile**

### Software Versions

* Software versions are identified by version numbers
* Version numbers indicate:
    * When the software was released
    * When it was updated
* If any minor changes or fixes were made to the software
* Software developers use versioning to keep track of new software, updates, and patches
* Version numbers can be short or long with 2, 3 or 4 sets.
* Each number set is divided by a period.
* An application with a 1.0 version number indicates the first release.
* Software with many releases and updates will have a larger number.
* Some use dates for versioning, such as Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2 release in 2018 April, with a change shown in the third number set.

**What do version numbers mean?**
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a period like: **`version 9.1.33.6`**
* The first number indicates major changes to the software, such as a new release
* The second number indicates that minor changes were made to a piece of software
* The third number in the version number indicates patches or minor bug fixes
* The fourth number indicates build numbers, build dates, and less significant changes

**Version Compatibility**
* Older versions may not work as well in newer versions
* Compatibility with old and new versions of software is a common problem.
* Troubleshoot compatibility issues by viewing the software version.
* U date software to a newer version tRat is compatible.
* Backwards-compatible software functions properly with older versions of files, programs, and systems.

### Software Testing

* Integrate quality checks throughout SDLC.
* Purpose:
    * Ensure software meets requirements.
    * Error-free software.
* Test Cases
    * Verify functionality and requirements
        * Steps
        * Data
        * Inputs
        * Expected Outputs

***Three Types of Software Testing***
1. **Functionality Testing**
2. **Non-Functionality Testing**
3. **Regression Testing**

#### 1. **Functionality Testing**

```plaintext
                  ___________
Input ---------> | Black Box | -------> Output
                 |___________|
               System Under Test
```
**How to do Functionality Testing**
* Manually

* Accessibility

#### 2. **Non-Functionality Testing**

**Non-Functionality Testing Attributes**
* Performance
* Security
* Availability
* Scalability

**Non-Functionality Testing Questions**
* How does the application behave under stress?
* What happens when many users log in at the same time?
* Are instructions consistent with behavior?
* How does the application behave under different OSs?
* How does the application handle disaster recovery?
* How secure is the application?

#### 3. **Regression Testing**

* Confirms changes don't break the application.
* Occurs after fixes such as a change in requirements or when defects are fixed.

**Choosing test cases for regression testing**
* *Choose test cases that contain:*
    * Frequent Defects
    * Frequently used functionality
    * Features with recent changes
    * Randomly successful or failed cases
    * Edge cases
    * Complex cases

#### Testing Levels

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Unit] --> B[Integration]
    B --> C[System]
    C --> D[Acceptance]
```

#### Unit Testing
* Test a module of code
* Occurs during the build phase of the SDLC
* Eliminate errors before integration with other modules

### Integration Testing

* Identify errors introduced when two or more modules are combined.
* Type of black-box test.
* Occurs after modules are combined into the larger application.

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 

* Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software. 
* Responsibilities of a software engineer include designing, building, and maintaining software systems.  
* Using the SDLC can improve efficiency and reduce risks by:  
    * letting team members know what they should be working on and when  
    * facilitating communication between the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team 
    * letting stakeholders know where they fit into that process  
    * letting cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks so development can move to the next phase.â€¯â€¯ 
* Common software engineering processes are requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, releasing, and documenting. 
* The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting requirements from the stakeholders, documenting the requirements, analyzing, prioritizing, and confirming the requirements. 
* An SRS is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance. 
* A URS is a subset of the SRS that details user specification requirements. 
* The SysRS contains the same information as an SRS, but can also additionally include system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria. 
* Waterfall, V-shape model, and agile are all different methodologies for implementing the software development life cycle. 
* Functional testing is concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test, non-functional testing tests for attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and availability. Whereas regression testing confirms that a recent change to the application, such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality. 
* Types of documentation include requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and user. 
* There are many different roles involved in a software engineering project. Some of them include project manager or scrum master, stakeholder, system or software architect, UX designer, software developer, tester or QA engineer, site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and technical writer or information developer.

### Basics of Website Interaction

The server will return:
* HTML defines the structure and content of the page.
* CSS add style and flair to the page.
* JavaScript adds  interactivity and dynamic content.
* Contents displayed by websites contain elements that are either:
![website](website.png)
Most website use a combination of static and dynamic content.

***Cloud Application***
* Built to work seamlessly with a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure.
* Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other Cloud services, making them scalable and resilient.

***Building website and Cloud Application***
* The environment is divided into two primary areas:
1. **Front-End**
> * Deals with everything that happens at the client-side.
> * Specializes in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS< JavaScript and related frameworks, libraries, and tools.

2. **Back-End**
> * Deals with the server before the code and data are sent to the client.
> * Handles the logic and functionality and the authentication processes that keep data.
> * Back-end developers may also work with relational or NoSQL databases.


Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge, and experience in both front-end and back-end environments.

* To create a website, web developers usually use:
    * Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
        * HTML is used to create the physical structure of a website with:
            * Text
            * Links
            * Images/Videos
            * Page Dividers
            * Buttons
    * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
        * CSS provides front-end developers with a standard method to define apply, and manage different sets of style characteristics for a website and each of its components.
        * CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colors, fonts, designs and layouts.
    * JavaScript
        * JS is an object-oriented programming language that is used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to add interactivity to a website.

***APIs, Routing, Endpoints :**
* APIs, routes, and endpoints process requests from the front-end
    * API is a code that works with data
    * Route is a path to a website or page
    * Endpoint can be an API or route
* Back-end developers create routes to direct requests to the correct service
* APIs provide a way for Cloud Apps to access resources from the back-end.

<center> <h2> Module 3: Programming Language and Organization </h2> </center>

**What are programming language?**

* Help us tell computers what to do 
* Computer language is called machine code
* Machines understand binary, Is and 0s
* Human-readable programming languages communicate with computers

* Common programming languages categories:
    * Interpreted
    * Compiled
* Many programming languages are compiled languages and interpreted languages
* The developer determines which language is best suited for the project

**Interpreted Programming**
* Scripted or scripting language.
* Operates through the interpreter on your computer or browser
* Translates human-readable scripted code to machine code
* The computer completes the task
* Some interpreted programming languages are outdated
* Some are more versatile and easier to learn languages
* Interpreted programming languages need an interpreter to translate the source code
* Translators are built into the browser or require a program on your computer to interpret the code

**Compiled Programming**
* Programs that you run on your computer
* Packaged or compiled into one file
* Usually larger programs
* Used to help solve more challenging problems, like interpreting source code

* **High-level programming languages**
    * More sophisticated
    * Use common English
    * SQL, Pascal, Python

* **Low-level programming languages**
    * Use simple symbols to represent machine code
    * ARM, MIPS, X86

**Query languages**
* A query is a request for information from a database
* The database searches its tables for information requested and returns results
* Important that both the user application making the query and the database handling the query are speaking the same language
* Writing a query means using predefined and understandable instructions to make the request to a database
* Achieved using programmatic code (query language/ database query language)

**Flowcharts**
* Graphical or pictorial representation of an algorithm
* Symbols, shapes, and arrows in different colors to demo a process or program
* Analyze different methods of solving a problem or completing a process
* Standard symbols to highlight elements and relationships

**Pseudocode**
* Simply explains each line of code
* Focuses more on logic
* Code development stage is easier
* Words/ phrases represent lines of computer operations
* Simplifies translation to code
* Code in different computer languages

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 

* Interpreted programming languages create source code that runs through an interpreter and is built into your operating system (OS) on your computer or on your web browser. 
* Compiled programming languages create executable files that are grouped in programs on your computer or device.  
* Query languages, structured programming languages, and object-oriented programming languages are categorized as high-level programming languages and assembly languages are categorized as low-level programming languages.  
* The two main methods of organizing and planning code are by developing flowcharts and by writing pseudocode. Flowcharts are pictorial representations of algorithms and pseudocode is an explanation of the function of each line of a program. 
* To reference a program component, software developers use an identifier, which can either be a constant or a variable.  
* A function is a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that will perform a single specific action.  
* Object-oriented programming is a programming methodology that is focused on objects rather than functions.

* Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 
* Software architecture functions as a blueprint and represents the importance of a good architectural design. 
* Structured design breaks down a software problem into well-organized smaller solution elements whereas behavioral models describe the behavior of the system without explaining how the system implements the behavior. 
* Developing UML diagrams saves time and money by helping developers quickly get up to speed on a project, plan features in advance of coding, and navigate source code easily. Types of UML diagrams include state transition, interaction, and class diagrams.â€¯ 
* Objects contain data, and they also have behaviors that prescribe the actions the object can take,â€¯whereas classes are blueprints for objects.â€¯ 
* A service-oriented architecture (SOA) consists of loosely coupled services that interface with each other via a communication protocol over a network. Distributed systems run on multiple services on different machines, but they appear to the end-user as a single coherent system. 
* An architectural pattern is a repeatable solution to an architectural problem. Types of architectural patterns include 2-tier, 3-tier, event-driven, peer-to-peer, and microservices. Two or more patterns can be combined in a single system, but some are mutually exclusive.â€¯ 
* Application environments include development, testing or QA, staging, and production. Production environments tend to be more complex than pre-production because they must take into account non-functional requirements like load, security, reliability, and scalability.â€¯ 
* Application environments can be deployed either on-premises on traditional hardware, or on public, private, or hybrid cloud platforms. 
* Common components needed for a production environment include a firewall, a load balancer, web and application servers, proxy servers, and database servers.
